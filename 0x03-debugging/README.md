This directory contains several programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-main.c](0-main.c) - This file contains the main function of the program. It prompts the user to input two integers and then calls a function to compute the sum of these numbers.
- [1-main.c](1-main.c) - This file also contains the main function of the program. It prompts the user to input three integers and then calls a function to find the largest of these numbers.
- [2-largest_number.c](2-largest_number.c) - This file contains the implementation of the function called by the main function in 1-main.c. The function takes three integers as input and returns the largest of these numbers.
- [3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c) - This file contains the implementation of a function that takes three arguments representing a date (day, month, and year) and prints the number of days remaining in that year.
- [main.h](main.h) - This header file contains the function prototypes for the functions defined in the other source code files.
