This directory contains several C programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-putchar.c](0-putchar.c) - a program that prints \_putchar, followed by a new line.
- [1-alphabet.c](1-alphabet.c) - a program that prints \_putchar, followed by a new line.
- [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](2-print_alphabet_x10.c) - a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [3-islower.c](3-islower.c) - a function that checks for lowercase character.
- [4-isalpha.c](4-isalpha.c) - a function that checks for alphabetic character.
- [5-sign.c](5-sign.c) - a function that prints the sign of a number.
- [6-abs.c](6-abs.c) - a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- [7-print_last_digit.c](7-print_last_digit.c) - a function that prints the last digit of a number.
- [8-24_hours.c](8-24_hours.c) - a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- [9-times_table.c](9-times_table.c) - a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- [10-add.c](10-add.c) - a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- [11-print_to_98.c](11-print_to_98.c) - a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
- [100-times_table.c](100-times_table.c) - a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
- [101-natural.c](101-natural.c) - a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
- [102-fibonacci.c](102-fibonacci.c) - a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
- [103-fibonacci.c](103-fibonacci.c) - a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
- [104-fibonacci.c](104-fibonacci.c) - a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
