This directory contains several programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-puts_recursion.c](0-puts_recursion.c) - A program that uses recursion to print a string followed by a new line.
- [1-print_rev_recursion.c](1-print_rev_recursion.c) - A program that uses recursion to print a string in reverse.
- [2-strlen_recursion.c](2-strlen_recursion.c) - A program that uses recursion to find the length of a string.
- [3-factorial.c](3-factorial.c) - A program that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
- [4-pow_recursion.c](4-pow_recursion.c) - A program that uses recursion to calculate the value of a number raised to a given power.
- [5-sqrt_recursion.c](5-sqrt_recursion.c) - A program that uses recursion to calculate the square root of a number.
- [6-is_prime_number.c](6-is_prime_number.c) - A program that uses recursion to check if a number is prime.
- [100-is_palindrome.c](100-is_palindrome.c) - A program that uses recursion to check if a string is a palindrome.
- [101-wildcmp.c](101-wildcmp.c) - A program that uses recursion to compare two strings, where the second string can contain a wildcard character.
