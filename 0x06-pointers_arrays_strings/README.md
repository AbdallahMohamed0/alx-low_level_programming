This directory contains several programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-strcat.c](0-strcat.c) - This function concatenates two strings. It takes two input strings and appends the second string to the end of the first string.
- [1-strncat.c](1-strncat.c) - This function is similar to 0-strcat.c, but it only appends up to a specified number of bytes from the second string to the end of the first string.
- [2-strncpy.c](2-strncpy.c) - This function copies a specified number of bytes from one string to another. If the source string is shorter than the specified number of bytes, the rest of the destination string is filled with null characters.
- [3-strcmp.c](3-strcmp.c) - This function compares two strings lexicographically. It returns an integer value depending on whether the first string is greater than, equal to, or less than the second string.
- [4-rev_array.c](4-rev_array.c) - This function reverses the contents of an array of integers.
- [5-string_toupper.c](5-string_toupper.c) - This function changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- [6-cap_string.c](6-cap_string.c) - This function capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
- [7-leet.c](7-leet.c) - This function encodes a string into "leet" or 1337 speak, replacing certain letters with numbers.
- [100-rot13.c](100-rot13.c) - This function encodes a string using the ROT13 encryption, where each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions down the alphabet.
- [101-print_number.c](101-print_number.c) - This function prints an integer.
- [102-magic.c](102-magic.c) - This function changes the value of an integer to 98.
- [103-infinite_add.c](103-infinite_add.c) - This function adds two numbers given as strings.
- [104-print_buffer.c](104-print_buffer.c) - This function prints the content of a buffer in a readable format.
