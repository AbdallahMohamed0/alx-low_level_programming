This directory contains several programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [libmy.a](libmy.a) - The libmy.a library is built to provide a set of useful functions that can be used in various C programs. The library contains a variety of functions related to string manipulation, memory management, and other useful utilities.
- [create_static_lib.sh](create_static_lib.sh) - Bash script that creates a static library called libmy.a from all the C files in the current directory.
