This directory contains several programs that I have created. Below is a list of the programs and a brief description of what each one does.

- [0-malloc_checked.c](0-malloc_checked.c) - This file contains a function that dynamically allocates memory using malloc and checks if it was successful.
- [1-string_nconcat.c](1-string_nconcat.c) - This file contains a function that concatenates two strings, up to a specified number of characters.
- [2-calloc.c](2-calloc.c) - This file contains a function that dynamically allocates memory using calloc and initializes the allocated memory to zero.
- [3-array_range.c](3-array_range.c) - This file contains a function that creates an array of integers with values ranging from min to max.
- [100-realloc.c](100-realloc.c) - This file contains a function that reallocates memory previously allocated with malloc or calloc.
- [101-mul.c](101-mul.c) - This file contains a function that multiplies two positive numbers represented as strings.
